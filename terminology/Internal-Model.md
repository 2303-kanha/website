An **Internal Model** is the model of reality that you carry around in your head.  

## Teams

If you're working in a team, then as a team you'll all have experienced reality differently, and therefore, you'll all have built
a slightly different **Internal Model**.  

Probably, you'll talk with the people on your team, and discuss the differences in your models to try and get everyone consistent.

## It Consists Of...

 - The [goal](Goal-In-Mind) you're trying to get to
 - The [risks you foresee](Attendant-Risk) to that goal
 - And how you evaluate those risks
 
 
## Code

When we write code, we are committing our **Internal Model** of reality to bits and bytes:  the form of the code we create, the choices we make and the parts of the software we choose to work on are informed by our **Internal Model**.  From one point of view, then, a codebase is an **Internal Model Made Real**.
