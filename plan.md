- Conceptual purity is key.  _Not a word out of place_. (Maybe lighten it up in the examples?)
- This is a _practitioner's guide_, not science.  Don't get caught up in that.  (But sure, refer to it if need be).

We need to understand what helps and what hinders what.  Can we make a spreadsheet?

1. Complete first draft on all risks (part 2). Then, we'll have 2 parts in first draft.

2. Practice by publishing a proof of an ebook with this.  We'll need to use pandoc to convert to pdf.

3. Waterfall has 5 practices.  Finish the articles on those.

4. Figure out what the diagram for each practice should look like.

5. We need to sort out how to get this really reviewed.   Put some articles on Hacker News to generate interest.  Can we offer a reward?

6. Create the methodology pages for Scrum, Extreme Programming, Lean (Kanban).  Fill in the practices for those.

7. Finish editing up the articles.  Are we definitely including them?

Analysis

1.  We definitely know that the practices we're using aren't framed correctly.  It needs to change.
2.  People are sick of agile.  
3.  Yeah, none of this is new.  If it were, that would actually be a problem.
4.  We're doing a martin fowler:  explaining and curating existing ideas and placing them in context.
