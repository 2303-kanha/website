Having large cycles in a waterfall project of many months or many people has been shown to be a recipe for cost and budget overruns.  But, the _same techniques_ underpinning Agile 

## Risks Prioritised

You can see the priority Waterfall places the risks by observing the order of the steps:

### 1.  [Cost Of Implementation](Production-Risk)

It's likely that the Waterfall-Style methodologies were inspired by the construction industry, wherein we try to [Design Up Front] in order to avoid the cost of re-work:  once concrete is poured, it's expensive to change it again, compared to the cost of updating the design in a diagram.  In the same way, 

### 2.  [Lots Of Stakeholders](Too-Many-Cooks)

In any construction project, there are likely to be lots of stakeholders - landowners, neighbours, government, clients and so on.   
Waterfall tries to mitigate this risk by getting [Sign-Offs](Sign-Off) as it goes along.

### 3.  [Cost Of Testing](Testing)

When Waterfall was originally conceived, automated testing techniques were not well established.  If you expect to perform a large [manual testing cycle](Testing) for each release, then clearly, few releases looks cheaper on paper.  

### 4.  Need For Dates



According to the Wikipedia article, 


## Defining Characteristics

- As shown in the diagram above, the software process is broken into distinct stages, to be carried out one-after-another.
- At the end of each stage is a [sign-off](Sign-Off), where the results of the stage are completed. 

What risks does it prioritise?

- [Technical Debt] 


### Variations

- [Prototyping](Spike-Solution):  Picking a particularly high-risk part of the project (such as UI elements) and delivering it first.  
- [Business Case](Cost-Benefit-Analysis): Adding a stage in the at the start of the project to perform some benefits calculations.
- [Cycles](Prioritisation): Delivering in multiple, incremental stages.
