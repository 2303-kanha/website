A gradient-descent approach to minimizing software risk, seen in the wild.

The HSBC Story of MicroServices:

- use microservices  ( no one remembers why)
- you break the compiler because now everyone is using different languages
- no consistent model of software correctness.. software evolves
- what risks does this manage?  Why did they focus on these risks?
- production risk
- therefore, release (very) often
- is DevOps maturity measured in releases per day?

- all the tools replace other, existing tools, but are worse because fewer people use them and so the feedback loop is less.
