## Welcome to Risk-First

Scrum, Waterfall, Lean, Prince2:  what do they all have in common?  

One perspective is that they are individual [software methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process#Methodologies), offering different viewpoints on how to build software.

However, here, we are going to consider a second perspective:  that building software is all about _managing risk_, and that these methodologies are acknowledgements of this fact, and they differ because they have _different ideas_ about which are the most important _risks to manage_.

## Goal

Hopefully, after reading through some of the articles on this short website, you'll come away with:

- An appreciation of how risk underpins everything we do as developers, whether we want it to or not.
- A framework for evaluating [software methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process#Methodologies) and choosing the right one for the task-at-hand.
- A recontextualization of the software process as being an exercise in mitigating different kinds of risk.
- The tools to help you decide when a methodology is _letting you down_, and the vocabulary to argue for when it's a good idea to deviate from it.

## What This is Not

This site isn't going to be an exhaustive guide of every possible software development practice and methodology.  

There are plenty of places you can find that information already.  Where possible, this site will link to or reference recommented further reading on each subject.

Neither is this Wiki meant to be an open-ended discussion of software techniques like [Ward's Wiki](http://wiki.c2.com).  In order to be concise and useful, discussions need to be carried out by opening an issue.

## Table of Contents

There are basically five parts to this work:  Parts 1 and 2 really need to be read in sequentially, as they'll explain the concepts you need to digest the rest.  But Parts 3, 4 and 5 don't have a linear structure, you can dive in anywhere after reading the first two.

### Part 1: [Introduction](Introduction)
