Here, I am going to recap some pre-existing knowledge about risk, generally, in order to set the scene for the next section on [Meeting Reality](Meeting-Reality).

## Risk Registers

In the previous section [Software Project Scenario](Software-Project-Scenario) we saw how you try to look across the [Attendant Risks](Attendant-Risk) of the project, in order to decide what to do next.  

A [Risk Register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_register) can help with this.  From the article:

```
A typical risk register contains:

- A risk category to group similar risks
- The risk breakdown structure identification number
- A brief description or name of the risk to make the risk easy to discuss
- The impact (or consequence) if event actually occurs rated on an integer scale
- The probability or likelihood of its occurrence rated on an integer scale
- The Risk Score (or Risk Rating) is the multiplication of Probability and Impact and is often used to rank the risks.
- Common mitigation steps (e.g. within IT projects) are Identify, Analyze, Plan Response, Monitor and Control.

```

## Graphical Analysis

The [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_register) also includes this wonderful diagram showing you risks of a poorly run barbecue party:

This type of graphic is _helpful_ in deciding what to do next, although personally I prefer to graph the overall Risk Score against the cost of mitigation:   easily mitigated, but expensive risks can therefore be dealt with first (sometimes).

## Unknown Unknowns

In Wikipedia's example, this ficticious BBQ has high fire risk, so one should begin mitigating there.  

But, does this feel right?  One of the criticisms on the site is that of "mistaking the map for the territory".  In the preceeding discussions, I have been careful to point out [Hidden Risks](Attendant-Risk) for that very reason. Or, to put another way:

Donald Rumsfeld's famous [Known Knowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns) is also useful background.

## Risk And Uncertainty

Arguably, this site uses the term 'Risk' wrongly:  most literature suggests [risk can be measured](https://keydifferences.com/difference-between-risk-and-uncertainty.html).

Long-running vs short running

## Deadlines

Sometimes, there are hard deadlines on projects.  In cases such as these
