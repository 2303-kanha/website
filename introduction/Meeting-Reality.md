In this section, we will look at how exposing your [Internal Model](Internal-Model) to reality is in itself a good risk management technique.

## Revisiting the Model

In the [Introduction](Introduction), we looked at a basic model for how **Reality** and our **Internal Model** interacted with each other.   

And, in [Development Process](Development-Process) we looked at how we can meet with reality in different forms:  Analysis, Testing, Integration and so on, and saw how the model could work in each stage.

Finally, in [Software Project Scenario](Software-Project-Scenario) we looked at how we could use this model on a day-to-day basis to inform what we should do next.  

So, it should be no surprise to see that there is a _recursive_ nature about this:  the **actions** we perform each day have consequences:  they **expose new [Hidden Risks](Attendant-Risk)**, which inform our [Internal Model](Internal-Model), and at the same time, they change reality in some way (otherwise, what would be the point of doing them?)

So, let's see how this kind of recursion looks on our model:

## Iterations

In the [Development Process](Development-Process), we had four steps between a feature being an "idea" to being ready for production.  (Putting the idea in production would count as a 5th step, too).  So, that's 5 times.  What is the right number of steps?  

- If you have more steps, the process is more complex, and will take longer.
- But, more steps is clearly _safer_
- Can we 

## Cadence

How _fast_ should we go round this loop?  Is there a right answer?  The longer you leave your [goal in mind](Goal-In-Mind), the longer it'll be before you find out how it really stacks up against reality.  

Testing your [goals in mind](Goal-In-Mind) early and safely is how you'll manage risk effectively.
