Where do the risks of the project lie?  

Let's first consider a project that's in production, and has paying clients using it.  How should we decide how to spend our time on a day to day basis?  What actions should we take?

##  Modelling The Risk Landscape

If we want to take the right actions, we need to have a good [Mental Model](mental_model.md).  Sometimes, we will know that our model is deficient, and our time should be spend _improving_ it, perhaps by talking to our clients, or the support staff, or other developers.

Our [Goal In Mind](goal_in_mind.md) might be to grow our user base, but there are [Attendant Risks](attendant_risk.md) that come with that goal, such as:

1. The users can’t access it
2. The data gets lost, stolen. 
3. The data is wrong or corrupted
4. There are bugs that prevent the functionality working
5. The functionality isn’t there that the user needs.

## Outcomes

As well as the positive outcome of our goal, we can also predict some negative outcomes if these risks materialise:

* Losing Revenue
* Legal Culpability
* Losing Users
* Bad Reputation
* etc.
