## What Is It

Prioritisation is a key process in trying to focus on building _useful_ stuff first.   It could look like:

 - [A Sprint Planning Meeting](Agile): Deciding on the most important things for the team to build in a time period.
 - [Phased Delivery](Waterfall): Breaking a large project into smaller-scoped projects.
 - [A Backlog](Lean): Having tasks or stories in delivery order in a queue.
 - [Task Decomposition]():  Breaking down larger units of a task into smaller items.  Often, [Requirements](Requirements-Capture) come _bundled together_ and need to be broken down a bit so that we work on just the most vital parts, as in
 - [Identifying the MVP](): Trying to cast out _all_ non-essential functionality.    
 
**Prioritisation** relies on not delivering all the functionality in one go.  But it tends to be a spectrum:

- **Big Bang**:  Delivering all the functionality in a single go.
- **Cycles, or Phases**:  Splitting a large project into smaller chunks.
- **Sprints**: Delivering with a fixed cadence, e.g. every month or week.
- [Continuous Delivery](Continous-Delivery): Delivering functionality one-piece-at-a-time.

Usually, risk is mitigated by **Prioritisation**.  But sometimes, it's not appropriate:  When Finland changed from driving on the right side of the road to the left, (in order to be in line with the rest of Europe) the changeover _had_ to be **Big Bang** and the whole country changed [overnight]().

## How It Works

There are several ways you can prioritise work:

- **Largest Mitigation First**:  What's the thing we can do right now to reduce our [Attendant Risk](Attendant-Risk) most?  This is sometimes hard to quantify, given [Hidden Risk](Attendant-Risk), so maybe an easier metric is...
- **Biggest Win**:  What's the best thing we can do right now to reduce [Attendant Risk](Attendant-Risk) for least additional [Schedule-Risk](Schedule-Risk)?  (i.e. simply considering how much *work* is likely to be involved)
- **Dependency Order**:  Sometimes, you can't build Feature A until Feature B is complete.   Prioritisation helps to identify and mitigate [Dependency Risk](Dependency-Risk).

## Feedback Loops / Risks Mitigated

### [Review](Sign-Off) 

This one way in which a particular prioritisation [Meets Reality](Meeting-Reality):

- Developers might tell you that the ordering incurs [Dependency Risk](Dependency-Risk) or [Coordination Risk](Coordination-Risk) if everyone is going to end up working on the same components.
- Product Owners might tell you that you're not tackling the right [Feature Risk](Feature-Risk).
- If you're trying to work out what the [MVP]() is, prioritisation might help your investors determine whether the project is worth the effort [Funding Risk](Funding-Risk).


## Attendant Risks


**Prioritisation** as a process d


- Lots of releases may increase costs of delivery, testing, training.
- Replacing processes is usually better incrementally, but you have complexity risk while you're running both systems.
