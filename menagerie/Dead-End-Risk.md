## Summary

Dead-End Risk is where you build functionality that you _think_ is useful, only to find out later that actually, it was 
a dead-end, and is superceded by something else.

Sometimes, the path from your starting point to your goal on the [Risk Landscape](Risk-Landscape) will take you to dead ends:  places 
where the only way towards your destination is to lose something, and do it again another way.
