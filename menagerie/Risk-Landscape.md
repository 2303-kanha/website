What are risks?

## Financial Crisis

In the [Banking]() industry, lots of effort is spend calculating things like [Market Risk]() and [Credit Risk]().  These were computed in monetary terms, like:  

> "we have a 95% chance that today we'll lose less than Â£100"

They talk of [Exposure](), and how much they're on the line for, given a specific event occurring.  

In the financial crisis, though, it didn't play out like this.   Liquidity difficulties caused some banks to not be able to cover their interest payments, which caused credit defaults (the thing that Credit Risk measures were meant to guard against) and that meant that, in time, banks got bailed out, share prices crashed and there was lots of quanitative easing, which had massive impacts on the markets (the thing that Market Risk measures were meant to guard against).

Everything was _correlated_.

## The Risk Landscape Again

It's like this with software risks, too, sadly.  

In [Meeting Reality](Meeting-Reality), we looked at the concept of the [Risk Landscape](Risk-Landscape), and how a software project tries to _navigate_ across this landscape, testing the way as it goes, and trying to get to a position of _more favourable risk_.

In this section, I am going to try and show you some of the geography of the [Risk Landscape](Risk-Landscape).  We know every project is different, so every [Risk Landscape](Risk-Landscape) is also different.  But, just as I can tell you that the landscape outside your window will probably will have some roads, trees, fields, forests, buildings, and that the buildings are likely to be joined together by roads, I can tell you some general things about risks too.

In fact, we're going to try and categorize the kinds of things we see on this risk landscape.  This isn't going to be perfect - sometimes, one risk "bleeds" into another, as we saw in

the just like sometimes a field is a car-park or a building contains a tree.   




Product Risks,

Staff Risks,

Customer Risks

How they intersect.


Explain what we'll look at with each risk.


- We need a diagram of how they interact.
