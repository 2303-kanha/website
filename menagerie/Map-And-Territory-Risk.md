**Map And Territory Risk** is 

Risk that people believe the constructions they create.  Perhaps a kind of bureaucratic risk?


Deliberately ignoring reality, and working in models.




## Groupthink

Cutting yourself off from the world and building castles in the sky.



- Large organisations suffer more, because they lose touch with reality and deal with themselves.


## Metrics


Focusing on number of releases, for example.  

Mistaking metrics for the real thing.  Gaming metrics

Code Coverage
SLOC
Function Points
Story Points and Burndown


Drinking the Coolaid - when you advertise your own metrics and then believe in them (which is Agency Risk now).

Are you testing the right thing?


## Hubris



## The Onion Of Bullshit



## Inadequate Equilibria

The problem is, whilst the world is _just a bunch of atoms_, everything else is subjective:  it's all maps inside our heads.
